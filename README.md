Background and Motivation
To assist people and new professionals was the development of this program.  It is hard for people to have any idea where to begin or how to continue to progress in their careers when there are so many options to choose from.  There obviously needed to be an overall, tailored solution even if most sites specialize in personal matters like resume creation or job listings.
The app's concept is based on the premise that professional development is a dynamic, ongoing process.  Professionals require continuous, customized help in responding to changing job markets and moving skills.  Through the combination of networking, skill development, job search tools, and career exploration, the app will make it easier and enable users to see it through from start to finish.
By giving the users, the resources, knowledge, and support they require to make educated, confident professional choices, and to impact long-term development.

The ultimate objective of this is to empower users.

Scope and Limitations
Academics and kickstarting professionals can indulge in networking opportunities, 
job search guides, skill acquisition tools, and individualized career guidance.  
Facilitating career paths specific to individuals, building resumes, monitoring jobs,
and developing skills with inbuilt courses and industry connectivity is part of its capability.
Personalized counselling initiative does have some drawbacks like the necessity of correct data to 
provide suggestions and the possible difficulties in developing partnerships with businesses and education establishments. 
Moreover, its viability is based on the participation of users, continuous improvement of skills, and changes in the labour market.
